# Rift Rewind Submission - Jomi Ruiz
This is my active codebase for a submission to AWS & Riot's Rift Rewind Hackathon! The main idea is to develop a product similar to Spotify Wrapped & Receiptify with their annual wrap ups. What I want to include is aspects such as a Total Gold Earned in a year, Total Annual KDA, and potential advice for users to improve their gameplay! I want to do this all in a fun & creative way that differs from both Spotify Wrapped & Receiptify.

# Accomplished
- Created Base Classes for Riot Accounts, Games, and Champion Database
- Successfully added API calls to pull realtime gamedata from Riot API
- Refactored code base to include base summaries of stats per game and links to PUUID and summoner name

# Current Deliverables
- Implement a Front-End application that can showcase your stats
- Include GenAI from AWS Bedrock or any GenAI service to return what player's can improve upon
- Use GenAI to give themes per player to add personalization / which champions they should pick up
